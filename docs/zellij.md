# Zellij

[Zellij](https://zellij.dev) is a **terminal multiplexer** (like tmux): it runs
*inside* one Ghostty window and lets you split it into panes, manage multiple
tabs, and — crucially — keep sessions alive in the background so you can detach
and reattach later without losing your work.

In this setup zsh auto-starts Zellij **only inside Ghostty** (see
[zsh.md](zsh.md)), so every Ghostty window drops you straight into a session.

- Your config: `zellij/config.kdl` → symlinked to `~/.config/zellij/config.kdl`

## Core concepts

```
Session  ──┬── Tab 1 ──┬── Pane
           │           └── Pane
           └── Tab 2 ──── Pane
```

- **Pane** — one shell (or program) in a rectangle of the screen.
- **Tab** — a full screen of panes; switch between tabs like browser tabs.
- **Session** — the whole thing. It lives in a background server, so you can
  **detach** (leave it running) and **reattach** later — even after closing
  Ghostty.

### Modes (the most important idea)

Zellij is **modal**. You're normally in *Normal* mode (typing into your shell).
To do something to the layout, you press a `Ctrl`-key to **enter a mode**, then
press a letter for the action, then `Enter`/`Esc` to go back. The status bar at
the bottom always shows the current mode and available keys — **read it**.

| Enter with | Mode    | What you do there                          |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Ctrl+p`   | Pane    | split, move between, close, fullscreen     |
| `Ctrl+t`   | Tab     | new tab, rename, move between tabs         |
| `Ctrl+n`   | Resize  | resize the focused pane                    |
| `Ctrl+s`   | Scroll  | scroll back, search the scrollback         |
| `Ctrl+o`   | Session | detach, switch session, plugin manager     |
| `Ctrl+h`   | Move    | move panes around                          |
| `Ctrl+g`   | Locked  | disable all Zellij keys (pass-through)     |
| `Ctrl+q`   | —       | quit the whole session                     |

> **Why `Ctrl+g` (Locked) matters:** if a program inside Zellij needs a key
> that Zellij intercepts (e.g. vim using `Ctrl+t`), press `Ctrl+g` to lock
> Zellij out, do your thing, then `Ctrl+g` again to unlock.

## Your config, explained

The config is [KDL](https://kdl.dev) — `key "value"` lines and `{ }` blocks.
`//` starts a comment.

```kdl
theme "catppuccin-mocha"
default_shell "zsh"
default_layout "compact"
```

- `theme` — Catppuccin Mocha, built in (no file to install).
- `default_shell` — new panes open zsh.
- `default_layout "compact"` — uses the slim single-line status bar instead of
  the default two-row bar (more screen for your work). Other built-ins:
  `default`, `strider` (with a file sidebar).

```kdl
pane_frames true
mouse_mode true
copy_on_select true
copy_command "wl-copy"
show_startup_tips false
scrollback_editor "vi"
```

- `pane_frames` — draws borders around panes (shows pane title / focus).
- `mouse_mode` — click to focus panes, drag borders to resize, scroll with the
  wheel.
- `copy_on_select` — selecting text copies it automatically.
- `copy_command "wl-copy"` — **Wayland** clipboard tool (Pop!_OS COSMIC is
  Wayland). On X11 change this to `xclip -selection clipboard`.
- `scrollback_editor "vi"` — in Scroll mode you can hit a key to open the whole
  scrollback in this editor for searching/copying.

```kdl
ui {
    pane_frames {
        rounded_corners true
        hide_session_name false
    }
}
```

- Cosmetic: rounded pane borders, and keep the session name shown in the frame.

## Day-to-day usage

A typical flow (remember: enter a mode, then press the letter):

**Split the screen:**
- `Ctrl+p` then `n` → new pane (or `r` = split right, `d` = split down)
- `Ctrl+p` then arrow keys / `h j k l` → move focus between panes
- `Ctrl+p` then `x` → close the focused pane
- `Ctrl+p` then `f` → toggle fullscreen for the focused pane

**Tabs:**
- `Ctrl+t` then `n` → new tab
- `Ctrl+t` then `r` → rename tab
- `Ctrl+t` then number → jump to that tab

**Resize:** `Ctrl+n` then arrows (then `Esc`).

**Scroll back / search:** `Ctrl+s` then `↑`/`PageUp`; press `s` to search.
`Esc` to return.

**Detach and reattach (the killer feature):**
- `Ctrl+o` then `d` → detach. Your session keeps running in the background; close
  Ghostty if you want.
- From any shell: `zellij list-sessions` (alias `zj ls` won't work — `zj` is just
  `zellij`, so `zj list-sessions`) to see them.
- `zellij attach <name>` → reattach exactly where you left off.

Because of `ZELLIJ_AUTO_ATTACH=true` in your `.zshrc`, opening a new Ghostty
window will **reattach** an existing session rather than spawning a fresh one.

## Common tweaks

**Switch theme:**
```kdl
theme "catppuccin-macchiato"
```

**Use the full two-row status bar instead of compact:**
```kdl
default_layout "default"
```

**On X11 instead of Wayland (clipboard):**
```kdl
copy_command "xclip -selection clipboard"
```

**Custom keybindings** — Zellij lets you remap everything in a `keybinds { }`
block. Start from the defaults: `zellij setup --dump-config > zellij/config.kdl`
gives you the *entire* default config (including all keybinds) to edit. Be aware
this replaces your minimal file with the full one.

**Custom layouts** — you can define a startup layout (e.g. editor on top, two
terminals below) as a `.kdl` file in `~/.config/zellij/layouts/` and launch it
with `zellij --layout mylayout`.
